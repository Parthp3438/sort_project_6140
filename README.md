You will implement some comparison-based sorting algorithms and observe performance for different input sizes.
 
Implement the following sorting algorithms.
Insertion sort
Merge sort
Heapsort [vector based, and insert one item at a time]
In-place quicksort (any random item or the first or the last item of your input can be pivot).
Modified quicksort
Use median-of-three as pivot.
For small sub-problem of size LaTeX: \le10â‰¤ 10 , you must use insertion sort.
Execution instructions:

Run these algorithms for different input sizes (e.g. LaTeX: nn = 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 10,000 .. 40,000, 50000, 60000). You will randomly generate input numbers for your input array. Record the execution time (need to take the average of several run) and plot them all in a single graph against various input sizes. Note that you will compare these sorting algorithms for the same data set.
Also observe and present performance of the following two special cases:
Input array is already sorted.
Input array is reversely sorted.
